  <b>Entry #2:</b> Today we worked on our Rube Goldburg project and we had to scrap a fair amount of our CAD since we started to fall behind in the physical building. I think it was better that way because some of the CAD elements were sketchy and didnt actualy work.

    <b>Entry #4:</b> We started and finished making a robtic hand to pick up a cup. It was made out of cardboard, string, and rubber bands. Our team had a really solid desighem but the fingers were over desined and it would have been easier ways to get the same result.
