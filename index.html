       <p><p><b>Entry #1:</b> I dont really know how to code in all honesty, and most of these things are really confusing. However this class is really fun and so far not too complex. We had a competition to get a marble in a jar by moving it through plastic pipes. We wernt aloud to touch the marble and it had to always be moving.</p>

<p><p><b>Entry #2:</b> Today we worked on our Rube Goldburg project and we had to scrap a fair amount of our CAD since we started to fall behind in the physical building. I think it was better that way because some of the CAD elements were sketchy and didnt actualy work. We origonaly had a see-saw element and a funnel but the see-saw was to much to handle. And the funnle was tricky to cut and implemnt, but even after sucsefully adding it to our design, we decided not to use it.  </p>
   
    <br> <hr style="height:0.5%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
    
    <p><p><b>Entry #3:</b> We finished our RG project and ours actualy worked properly. We ended and did a challenge where we had to design the letter E. I made my dimensions imposible to create and Dominic had a WONDERFUL time with it. </p>
    
    <br> <hr style="height:0.5%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
   
    <p><p><b>Entry #4:</b> We started and finished making a robtic hand to pick up a cup. It was made out of cardboard, string, and rubber bands. Our team had a really solid design but the fingers were over-designed and there were easier ways to get the same result. </p>
    
    <br> <hr style="height:0.5%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
   
    <p><p><b>Entry #5:</b> This week we started our bottle rocket project. Our group's CAD got finished pretty quickly and, like always, it looked pretty good. The actual build got finished quickly too, since we had 5 people in our team. </p>

    <p><p><b>Entry #6:</b> We finaly launched our bottle rockets today. Our team's rocket was made of a Minute Maid bottle and it actualy went far in comparison to the other rockets. A couple of the rockets turned around and flew backwards toward our class. It was pretty fun. </p>
    <br> <hr style="height:0.5%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
   <p><p><b>Entry #7</b> Today we attempted to filter dirty water. We were only given cotton, bottles, dirt, sand and rocks.
